# Intellij Light Color Scheme for Vim

This is a very basic, incomplete vim color scheme inspired by Intellij Light.  The initial colors were generated from [ThemeCreator](https://mswift42.github.io/themecreator/).  Minor ui tweaks for gvim were also made.

## Versions

**0.0.1**

- Initial commit  - some colors way off but I can live with that
